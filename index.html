          <p>As an international student myself, I know how hard it is to get a job in the US. The process to gain employment authorization is lengthy and cumbersome, and many companies are hesitant to hire international students. However, this does not mean there aren’t plenty of great ways to find work. Here are a few of the best ways to find on-campus and off-campus jobs if you are struggling.
          </p>
 
 
    <h4>On-Campus Employment</h4>
    <p>The best way to find an on-campus job is to visit different school offices to see if they have any openings. Usually, the job posting flyers are available on the front desk or on the wall if there are any vacancies available. You can also ask the front desk directly. Another way is to find out from your friends if they have been working any on-campus jobs. For example, once your friend leaves the job, the vacancy appears, and you can apply for it right away. In my case, my friend left her on-campus job and shared her supervisor’s email with me. I applied through the email explaining why I am a good fit and attached my resume. You can also apply for jobs on the school portal.
    </p>


    <p>The best time to find on-campus jobs is at the beginning of the semester because many students who worked at a particular office graduated from school or found off-campus jobs at the end of the previous semester. I recommend you start your on-campus job during your first or second semester not only because it doesn’t require Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT), but you can also apply for the Social Security Number (SSN) early, once you are offered the on-campus job.</p>

<h4>Off-Campus Employment </h4>
<p>Once you are familiar with the new environment in the US, you can start applying for off-campus jobs. There are many ways that you can apply for these jobs. But the following two methods have worked for me:</p>

     
<h5><li>Apply Through School</li></h5>
<p>I found that when I apply for jobs on the company websites or on some job boards, if I hear back from the company, it’s usually for a HireVue video interview. HireVue, if you don’t know, is an interview platform where you are asked to record your answers to given questions without actually speaking to another person. Because of the inconvenience of this process, I usually don’t proceed with the interview process. But when I apply for jobs or internships on the school career link, now Handshake, I can hear back from companies or recruiters and have a face-to-face interview with them. If you are still in school, make sure you don’t miss out on On-Campus Recruiting (OCR) as applications are only accepted during a certain window of time. It’s also worth noting that if you are active in a student club, especially those clubs that often host professional networking events, you will be more likely to be remembered by recruiters and to be selected in the OCR. If you are not active in any student clubs or you don’t like attending networking events, you can try my second suggestion below.</p>


<h5><li>Connect with Professionals in Your Dream Company on LinkedIn</li></h5>
<p>If you have graduated from school, there is another way you can get a job quickly. Try to connect with as many professionals in your dream company as you can on LinkedIn. What I found is that when there is a vacancy or position to be filled in their team, they usually post about it on LinkedIn. If you see this kind of post, you can reach out to them on LinkedIn, mentioning their post and explaining why you are a good fit for that role. Also, be sure to attach your resume. I think this way works better than simply asking for a referral from a professional you are not familiar with. Reaching out to companies that are actively looking for applicants is effective because they have a need, and you can fill that need. This means they are happy to pass your resume to the recruiters—it’s a win-win situation.</p>



<p>With all that said, there are still a lot of things you need to do on your end, like knowing your strengths, knowing what kind of job you want to do, and continually improving your varied skillsets needed in that field. As an international student, you also need to keep honing your communication skills. Then, all you need to do is market yourself on LinkedIn and make yourself visible. When you are ready, opportunities will come your way.</p>
